It provides a smooth user experience with dynamic content tailored to the user‚Äôs location and preferences. From searching and filtering movies to booking seats and getting personalized movie recommendations, CinePick offers it all!

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Microservice Architecture** using **Spring Boot** and **FastAPI** for high scalability and separation of concerns.
- **Responsive UI** built with **React.js** for a seamless experience on medium to large screens.

## üõ†Ô∏è Microservice Architecture

CinePick is structured using a microservice architecture to ensure flexibility and scalability:

- **MovieApp Microservice**: Handles authentication, basic CRUD operations (movies, theatres, shows, users, screens), and communicates with other microservices via RabbitMQ and REST APIs.
  
- **Booking Microservice**: Manages booking requests from the **booking_queue**, checking seat availability, and confirming or rejecting bookings accordingly.

- **History Microservice**: Tracks users' browsing activities, such as visited movie pages, and sends this data to the Recommender Microservice.

- **Recommendation Microservice**: A **FastAPI** microservice that uses browsing history to provide personalized movie suggestions.

RabbitMQ is utilized to prevent race conditions, ensuring that multiple users cannot book the same seat at the same time.

## üéüÔ∏è Dynamic Shows & Theatre Screens

## üîÆ Browsing History-Based Recommendations

CinePick tracks user behavior to offer movie recommendations based on:

- Recently visited movie pages.
- Movies reviewed by the user.
- Movies the user purchased tickets for.

These recommendations adapt to the user's actions during each session, ensuring a fresh experience every time they log in.
